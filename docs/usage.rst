To use oxfel in a project::

=================================================
Updating the model from the Longlist (Winni List)
=================================================

When a new longlist (also known as the Winni List) is published, it
may eventually be desirable to update oxfel's OCELOT model to
represent the new lattice description.  This is relatively easy and
can be done from the command line once oxfel has been installed.


The models can be updated with

```
$ oxfel update component_list_2023.07.01.xls
```
